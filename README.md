## Data Source
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System publishes quarterly tables with the following important points for our research: 
 * Name of bank
 * Bank ID (know as the RSSD ID, which is a unique identifier assigned to institutions by the Federal Reserve)
 * Consolidated assets

I created a automated data pipeline to:
*	Web scraping each quarterly link 
*	Transforming the data from HTML to CSV documents so that I can manipulate the data.
*	Data cleaning: standardization of column headers and data, adding columns that calculate percentages. 
*	Data wrangling: Setting master data frames, pivoting, concatenating dataframes that develop plot ready data frames.
*	Uploads data frames into Github repository.

The data pipeline was originally constructed to feed the "Consolidated Assets" tab of the Concentration of Banking data app (check the app at: https://www.concentration-of-banking.site/). Now, on a quarterly basis, the pipeline also updates the AI Banking Assets data app.
